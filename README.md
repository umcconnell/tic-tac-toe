## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need python3 and pip3 installed on your machine. You can install it
from the official website https://www.python.org/.

### Initial setup

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a virtual python
environment running:

Clone the git repository and navigate into the folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/umcconnell/tic-tac-toe.git
cd tic-tac-toe/
```

Then create your virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

To exit the virtual environment run

```bash
deactivate
```

Next, install the dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, start the app:

```bash
python main.py
# To play against an unbeatable AI, run:
# python main.py --ai minimax
```

Happy coding!

## Distributing

### Installing

To get started, activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the packages from `requirements.txt`:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installing additional packages

After activating the virtual environment, install your package(s):

```bash
python -m pip install <package>
```

Then freeze your packages:

```bash
python -m pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
